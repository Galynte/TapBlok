# TapBlok Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: January 06, 2026**

TapBlok is a privacy-first focus and app-blocking tool designed to run entirely on your device. We respect your privacy and have built TapBlok with the principle that **no personal data leaves your phone**.

### 1. Information We Collect
TapBlok collects **no personal information** and does not transmit any data to remote servers.

- **No account creation or login** is required.
- **No analytics, tracking, or advertising** services are used.
- **No data is uploaded** to any server, cloud, or third party.

### 2. Local Data Storage
All data used by TapBlok is stored **exclusively on your device** using Android's secure local storage:

- List of apps you choose to block (package names only)
- Focus session preferences (e.g., whether breaks are allowed, QR code controls)
- Counters for break attempts and blocked app openings

This data is only accessible to TapBlok and is never shared or transmitted.

### 3. Permissions Explained
TapBlok requests the following Android permissions only to provide its core functionality:

- **Display over other apps** (`SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`):  
  Used solely to show a temporary blocking overlay when you attempt to open a restricted app. TapBlok does **not** take screenshots, record your screen, or read content from other apps.

- **App usage access** (`PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS`):  
  Used only to detect the currently active app (package name only) so TapBlok can enforce blocking rules. No content, text, or personal data from apps is accessed.

- **Camera** (optional):  
  Requested only if you enable QR code scanning to start/stop monitoring sessions. The camera is used **exclusively** for scanning QR codes generated by TapBlok. No photos or videos are saved, stored, or transmitted.

- **NFC** (optional):  
  Used only if you choose to write or read NFC tags for session control.

You can revoke any permission at any time in your device settings without affecting other features.

### 4. Data Security
Since all data remains on your device:
- It is protected by your device's security (screen lock, encryption).
- Uninstalling TapBlok removes all associated data.

### 5. Children's Privacy
TapBlok does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us (see below).

### 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available within the app or at the link provided in the Google Play Store listing.
