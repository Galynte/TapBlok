# TapBlok
TapBlok is a digital wellbeing tool for Android designed to help you control screen time by creating real-world friction. By requiring a physical action (scanning an NFC tag or a QR code) to begin or end a blocking session, it makes it harder to impulsively bypass your own productivity goals.
